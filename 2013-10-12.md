This week we finished our first group project and had our presentations, then on Thursday we attempted to reproduce results.

Our group had a lot of difficulties, especially in miscommunication and miscoordination, but we ended up pulling through in the end. I noticed that a parallel workflow might have worked better for us, since we were often bottlenecked by waiting for output. Also, clearer instruction earlier on about what our final product should look like (ie. the presentation and the source code) would have saved us some trouble, as I had originally not made my process very reproducible because I didn't realize that was part of the rubric and someone in my group with more coding experience had to step up and cover for me later. 

Overall I felt very positive about the direction the course has been taking, as we have started learning and actually accomplishing things.
