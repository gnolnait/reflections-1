This week on we had our first iteration check-in. The various groups were able to pull together and present on what they had accomplished, despite the previous weekend being a shitstorm of different groups scrambling to find a SMART goal to work on to present. 

Over the weekend I decided to exercise my google-fu skills and emailed Luen asking about his work and his code. Surprisingly he replied with several questions that were very clarifying (which ETAS model, how were we comparing models, were we estimating or using pre estimated models).

Since several groups had expressed interest in tackling the analysis of the ETAS model, and after realizing in class that many people didn't have a clear idea of the big picture of our project, I decided to type up a writeup detailing the action steps we needed to take as a class to deal with the ETAS portion of our analysis. Carl then prompted me to do an impromptu presentation of it in class, which I obliged to give. 

On Thursday we spent class discussing and working among ourselves. I tried to talk to as many analyzers I could to make sure we were all on the same page. I met with the MDA group on Wednesday and with a member of the curators after class on Thursday, on top of normal meetings with my own small group. Unfortunately I forgot about an analyzer meeting scheduled with Chris on Friday. Should have used Google Calendar.
