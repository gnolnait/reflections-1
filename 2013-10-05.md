This week on Tuesday we discussed the first project and the horizontal and vertical groups that we had been assigned for it, in order for us to be clear on what the responsibilities of our roles were. On Thursday we heard the second half of Professor Stark's lecture on earthquake prediction, which I found very hilarious and elucidating, especially the e-mail/LaTeX vectored verbal smackdown that he delivered to Professor Seth Stein at Northwestern. His presentation touched on some very fundamental paradigmatic issues with how probability and statistics are used or misused in scientific research, especially the disconnect between the many assumptions made in all these convoluted models and reality. This strikes me as important because one of the major goals of reproducibility is increasing the rigor of statistical analysis in academia and disincentivizing falsification and fabrication of data as well as improper use of statistical models.

In regards to our group projects, unfortunately we had some coordination issues and three of us were only able to meet after Thursday's class. Our final member finally responded Saturday. With the late start we were a bit rushed, and as the curator unfortunately I became a bottleneck because I am unfamiliar with Python and virtual machines. Extremely busy on Friday, I spent much much longer than I anticipated on Saturday getting basic things to work like writing to a csv. file in Python in the right format and configuring the shared folder in my virtual machine to get my data out so I could clean in R with regex, which I had to refresh myself on also. It struck me that it would have been much more convenient if we were allowed to simply export the file from Google but I guess that's besides the point.
