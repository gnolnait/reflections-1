This week we did more work on the project during class. We were able to code from Luen which although there is some work to be done in order to understand how exactly it works (in particular we donâ€™t understand how he implements k the sweeping parameter) it solved most of the problems we had been tackling as analyzers in one fell swoop. More specifically, he gave us an implementation of the Veen-Schoenberg method (EM algorithm) to estimate ETAS parameters and to simulate ETAS, and code to generate an error diagram for ETAS and MDA that also finds the area under the curve, all of which we had been tackling. 

Now our focus shifted to the actual hard part, figuring out a better alarm function. It seemed many of the groups struggled to understand what to do and how to contribute as the optimization problem went over a lot of heads, as only a few of us had experience with linear programming and such. It seemed like most of the class had checked out of the project, the curators presenters and visualizers especially since it might be hard for them to think of ways to get involved. I met with Teresa, Jody, and Khoa on Wednesday and on Thursday we decided to combine our groups since we were done with the ETAS work and needed to focus our efforts on the MDA function.

Stark's office hours today was very helpful, as his suggestions for plotting the superimposed distributions of the first, second, etc. arrival times as well as a superposition of the sum was a great way to help visualize the function, as well as his suggestion to separate the magnitude that we turn on the alarm from the magnitude cutoff we are trying to predict. The intuition being that for small levels of alarm coverage we would want to turn on the alarm only when the magnitude is high. He helped brainstorm a preliminary form for what the function might look like, and what additional parameters to possibly include. This gives me a lot of ideas on what work can be done in terms of analysis to make progress as a class.
