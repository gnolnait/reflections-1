This week on Tuseday we did a code review on our first real assignment as well as went through the basics of clean and non-smelly code and how to avoid bad coding practices. On Thursday we discussed the updated grading standards as well as the specifics of our class project. Hopefully this will help to rein in the class and refocus the many who seemed to be losing interest in the class.
