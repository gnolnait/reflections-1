This week on a personal level I finally got my computer somewhat working (purchased an external cooling fan) while still waiting on my replacement part. After failing with Vagrant, I was quickly able to get VirtualBox working and installed pip, gspread, ipython notebook, etc. in like an hour.

we had several discussions on the nature, focus, and direction of the course. We discussed among other things, the big picture motivation for reproducibility and collaboration in science and the role of virtual boxes as a tool for such things, which I enjoyed and found rather interesting. We discussed the structure of the class and the instruction/grading, such as when the reflections should be due. Many people, myself included, voiced their dissatisfaction with the state of the class so far. The most typical complaint was lack of organization/structure/clear grading rubric, as well as the vast amount of time wasted on trouble-shooting and technical support. 

I am of the opinion that as Berkeley students we should be held responsible to figure out ourselves how to install a couple things. I can guarantee you if the instructors made it 20 percent of the course grade to have everything set up by the end of the second week, everyone would be done and we could have moved on with our lives and this class a month ago. The students are at fault for not taking proper responsibility for themselves and their peers, but the instructors should also be held responsible for not taking charge or providing a suitable forum for the students to help themselves (ie. Piazza rather than IRC). But like, that's just my opinion man.
