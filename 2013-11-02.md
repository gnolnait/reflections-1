This week we spent class working and discussing in our horizontal groups. I decided to become an analyzer after realizing data curation was not my calling, especially since we had 11 people assigned to a task that one or two people could do. I felt that the number of people in each role were not properly allocated, as the data curation part would become pretty redundant as soon as the data was properly read into a dataframe or whatnot. We certainly have challenges ahead of us.
