This week on Tuesday we talked about our second homework project, which was to plot earthquakes showing depth and magnitude by pulling JSON data from the USGIS. On Thursday Professor Stark continued to lecture on earthquake prediction and on the goals of our major class projects, which is to tune a simple alarm based prediction model to beat the convoluted ETAS model in prediction accuracy at all levels of coverage. 

Our group had several setbacks, including one group member who was completely unresponsive and hence contributed nothing, while another group member only contributed by checking and commenting the code. The work was mostly done by Tay who did most of the heavy lifting by curating the data, and me who parameterized and refactored the function to plot depth and magnitude as size and color. Unfortunately I was uncertain about the parameters of the assignment and we were not able to finish writing code to pull the bounding box coordinates for any input of state, which would have been convenient.
